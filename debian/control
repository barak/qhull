Package: libqhull5
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: calculate convex hulls and related structures (shared library)
 Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
 intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
 Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It
 runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions.
 .
 This package contains the shared C library.

Package: libqhull-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libqhull5 (= ${binary:Version}), libc6-dev
Description: calculate convex hulls and related structures (development files)
 Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
 intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
 Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It
 runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions.
 .
 This package contains the files necessary for development (headers and
 libraries), as well as the library documentation in HTML format.

Package: libqhull-doc
Section: doc
Architecture: all
Description: calculate convex hulls and related structures (documentation files)
 Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
 intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
 Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It
 runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for Qhull.

Description: calculate convex hulls and related structures (utilities)
 Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
 intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
 Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It
 runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions.
 .
 This package contains the qhull executable that gives a pipe interface to
 some of the functionality of the library.  Also included is rbox is a
 useful tool in generating input for Qhull; it generates hypercubes,
 diamonds, cones, circles, simplices, spirals, lattices, and random points.
 .
 Qhull produces graphical output for Geomview.  This helps with
 understanding the output (http://www.geomview.org).
