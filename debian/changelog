qhull (2003.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

    packaging files

      qhull library does not work correctly.  This has to do with some
      change in the toolchain (gcc 4.1.* series).
    + Call the test suite after building the qhull-bin package
    + Removed bashism in the install/libqhull-dev rule
